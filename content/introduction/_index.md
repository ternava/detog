# Feature Toggles Research

Welcome to a curated collection of research papers, articles, and resources on Feature Toggles (also known as Feature Flags).

This site contains academic papers, industry articles, and practical resources about feature toggles, their implementation, and best practices.

## About

Feature toggles are a powerful technique that allows teams to modify system behavior without changing code. This collection aims to provide researchers and practitioners with comprehensive resources on the topic.

## What are Feature Toggles?

Feature toggles, also known as feature flags or feature switches, are a software engineering technique that allows teams to turn features on or off without deploying new code. This enables:

- **Safe deployments**: Deploy code with features disabled
- **A/B testing**: Test different features with different user groups  
- **Gradual rollouts**: Slowly enable features for increasing percentages of users
- **Emergency switches**: Quickly disable problematic features
